 *
 * ```js
 * const EXPIRY_DATE = new Date(
 *   2023, // <-- The full year (4 digits)
 *   5,    // <-- The month (e.g. '0' will be January; '11' will be December)
 *   4     // <-- The date (1-31, depending on the month)
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * The expiry date is 90 days after the executable is compiled. This process is not automatic, so you must update this variable every time a new executable is compiled.
 *
 * To see the date in **90** days, [click here](https://www.google.com/search?q=Date+90+days+from+today).
